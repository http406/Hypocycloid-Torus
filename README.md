# Hypocycloid-Torus

### **Hypocycloid Torus: A Unique Geometric Shape**
A **Hypocycloid Torus** is a fascinating shape formed by the motion of a **smaller circle rolling inside a larger circle**, where the path traced by a point on the smaller circle generates a **hypocycloid curve**. When this motion is extended into **3D**, a **Hypocycloid Torus** is created.

### **Understanding the Parametric Equation**
The equation used in the code is based on the **parametric equations** of a **hypocycloid surface**. The standard form of the equations for a **Hypocycloid Torus** is:

Where:  
- **\( R1 \) = 1** â†’ A small constant radius controlling the base shape.  
- **\( R \) = 5** â†’ Radius of the large circle.  
- **\( r \) = 1** â†’ Radius of the smaller rolling circle.  
- **\( h \) = 1** â†’ Controls the height deformation of the shape.  
- **\( u \)** â†’ Rotational parameter (angle around the torus).  
- **\( v \)** â†’ Angle controlling the inner rolling motion.  

These parameters **control the shape of the torus**, adjusting its width, height, and complexity.

### **Breaking Down the Equation**
1. **Core Motion (`v` dependency)**
   - The **hypocycloid motion** comes from **\( \sin(v) \) and \( \cos(v) \)** terms.
   - The **(R/r)*v** term creates multiple loops due to the ratio between the two radii.

2. **Torus Shape (`u` dependency)**
   - The **cos(u)** and **sin(u)** terms create the **ring-like structure**.
   - This allows the shape to rotate around a **central axis**, forming the toroidal structure.

3. **Height Deformation (`h` term)**
   - The [h*sin{(R/r)*v}] and [h*cos{(R/r)*v}] terms control **vertical deformation**.
   - This is what gives the torus a **wavy or oscillating** appearance.

### **Why This Torus Looks Special?**
- Unlike a **normal torus**, which is smooth and circular, the **Hypocycloid Torus** has **sharp, wavy deformations**.
- These deformations result from the **rolling motion of a small circle inside a larger one**.
- The **mathematical beauty** of the **Hypocycloid Torus** is that it captures the symmetry of both **cycloidal curves and toroidal structures**.
